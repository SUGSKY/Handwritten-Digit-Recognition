# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

A program to predict handwritten digits in digitized format using the concept of Machine Learning and the popular classification algorithm called kNN (k-Nearest Neighbours). kNN is supervised based algorithm by majority vote of its neighbors. It is supervised in a sense that a sufficient large sample dataset of known target values is carefully selected. This sample dataset will be split into 2 groups. One group will be used to formula a kNN model to be used for prediction. It’s called Training. The other group is used to verify the accuracy of the established model, called Testing. The Training-Testing cycle might result in several iterations of tuning and adjustment until a satisfactory model is achieved with high accuracy of positive predictions, higher better. Once such a model has been implemented, it’s ready to make prediction. To make a prediction, simply feed an unknown value of same format to the program and then perform the required computation in accordance to the established kNN model.
